# What is this?

This repository is my personal stash for modding templates.
While they are primarily built for my usage, I prefer to build them in a generic format that can be re-used for
other projects and purposes.

This means that they can be used as a functionally public free-use template for modding.

## What's the difference?
The default modding MDKs are designed to be general-purpose and contain a lot of unnecessary boilerplate, 
but also don't bother to include some things that are useful for most modding situations.

Additionally, some templates tend to be designed in a way that's hard to expand on or modify as your needs change,
often making them more of a hindrance to work with than an asset.

I design my templates based on the following principles:
1. Be optimised
2. Be clean and easy to understand
3. Be easily modifiable/extensible
4. Be general-purpose and avoid niche implementation handling

## How do I use these?
Switch to the branch you want (depending on your project version and platform(s)), then click on the green `code` 
button up on the top right. In the `Local` tab, click `Download Zip`. This will give you a copy of the branch as a zip
file, which you can then extract into its own directory and open as a project in Intellij.

## Disclaimer
I do not offer any specific support for projects made from these templates.

See your usual modding support location if you are looking for support with any project using these templates
(I'm probably there anyway)
